# To-do Items

* Make the text message log work nicely:
  * Scroll with mouse wheel (or by keyboard command of course)
  * Add text to the bottom and auto-scroll to the bottom
  * Auto-remove text from the top
  * Make it so it can be resized/xpandable vertically to show more or less
    as the user desires

* Build out the TileManager test better:
  * Make a player icon and move it around the map
  * Test the unseen/seen/visible functionality
  * Allow modifier-movement keys to move the camera independently of
    the player moving. Move the camera back to the player on any
    unmodified movement keypress
