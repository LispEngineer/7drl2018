# To-do Items

* Build out the TileManager test better:
  * Make a player icon and move it around the map
  * Test the unseen/seen/visible functionality
  * Allow modifier-movement keys to move the camera independently of
    the player moving. Move the camera back to the player on any
    unmodified movement keypress

* Inventory system improvements
  * Build a pager, such that you can page through long lists of inventory
  * Have the pager handle window resize nicely
  * Make the inventory item possible to select by up/down arrows
